# Development Shell Snippets

This directory contains various short, self-contained JavaScript scripts
designed to work in the JavaScript console. These are probably only
useful when debugging development. Copy them into the console to run.
Or, for repeated use, into the Chrome Developer Tools Snippets (in the
file tree of Sources).

See details on the Developer Tools Snippets
[here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/snippets).
